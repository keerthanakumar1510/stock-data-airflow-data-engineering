# Stock Market Data Ingestion using Airflow Project
## Introduction
This is an end-to-end data engineering project which ingest stock market data from AlphaVantage API using Python & Airflow. The data is transformed and stored in S3 bucket which can be queried using Athena for analytical use case

### Technologies Used:
* **AWS Cloud (EC2, S3, Athena)**: EC2 is used to host Airflow webserver, S3 is used a a storage solution, Athena for querying purposes
* **Apache Airflow** : Airflow is used as an orchestration layer to monitor and manage workflows through DAGs
* **Python** : Python is used to specify the logic to extract, transform and load data from API

## Alpha Vantage API
Alpha Vantage provides realtime and historical financial market data through a set of powerful and developer-friendly data APIs. In this project, I have used **TIME_SERIES_DAILY API** which returns raw (as-traded) daily time series (date, daily open, daily high, daily low, daily close, daily volume) of the global equity specified: Amazon (AMZN) is the equity of interest in this project

## Pre-requisites
* EC2 instance: Instance type atleast t2.small or greater, OS image: Ubuntu
* Airflow installation: Follow **required-packages.sh** file for the commands
